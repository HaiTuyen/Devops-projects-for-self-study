# Setup A Static Website Using Niginx Project

This project marks my inaugural self-guided DevOps project, encompassing a step-by-step process for establishing a website. The project entails: 

- Setting up an Ubuntu Server.
- Accessing the server securely via SSH protocol and deploying Nginx as the web server.
- Configuring both the Ubuntu server and Nginx.
- Initiating firewall rules for enhanced security.
- Transferring website files (including .html, .css, .js, etc.)to the Nginx /var/www/ directory using SCP (Secure Copy Protocol).
- Registering a DNS (Domain Name System) account and associating the server's external IP address with a domain name.
- Leveraging Nginx's Server Block feature to host multiple websites on a single IP address.
- Accquiring a Let's Encrypt certificate to enable SSL encrytion for the hosted websites.

This project serves as an educational exercise, covering various aspects of web hosting and server management within a DevOps context.
